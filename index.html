                                Hi, 
                                <br>
                                I am a graduate student at <a href="">University at Buffalo</a> pursuing my masters of science in Data Science. I'll graduating in May of 2023.
                                I completed my bachelors of technology in Computer Science from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in India. I previously worked at Robert <a href="">Bosch Centre for Data Sciecne and AI</a> where I worked on multiple public health and healthcare analytics projects partenered with the State Government of Tamil, Nadu.
                                My fields of interest and research are Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, and Optimization algorithms.
                                <br>
                                During a summer internship at <a href="https://www.optisolbusiness.com">Optisol Business Solutions</a>, my mentor introduced cloud computing and machine learning using Amazon Web Services. Intriguied and enthused by this, I dove into this field. I gained more knowledged interning at <a href="http://prodian.co.in/index.html">Prodian Infotech</a>.
                                <br>
                                I completed two thesis as a requirement for distinction level completion of my bachelors. My first thesis was on implementing Natural Language Processing techniques to construct a Knowledge Graph. In my second thesis, I developed a neural network learning algorithm to implement an ensemble of timescale signals. 
                                The lockdown period in 2020 during the COVID-19 gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge by completing courses in various MOOCs.

                                    Omdena is a voluntary organization which specializes in solving real world problems using artificial intelligence. I was an active collaborator in three Omdena projects and I am statrting my fourth in February 2022.

                                            <span class="subtitle">Omdena WRI Land Management Project:</span> This project focused on developing a Knowledge Graph for the unstructured data from gazatte and court documents to solve land misappropriations in Kenya. 
                                            The raw data was collected, annotated, processed to find the important entities and then a Knowledge was constructed using the recognized entities and relationships.
                                            I was the task leader for the Named Entity Recognition task and an active participant in the Annotations task. Along with my team, I developed models to detect the major named entities such as places, numbers and owner details using Spacy, BERT and Attention based models.  We used a custom set of tags specific to our problem statement such as Owner Name, Deed Number, Property ID etc.
                                            We observed that the Spacy model gave the best accuracy of 96% and we extracted the entities from about 36000 gazatte documents from the time period 2005 to 2018.

                                            A pipeline which took numeric inputs to identify geopolitical risks and image data to identify climatic risks which then gave a score to the proposal based on the location input was designed.
                                            I was an active collaborator in the data collection task where we used image sources such as Sentinal 1, 2 and 2A to collect satellite images for modelling , and the image modelling task were we developed image segmentation models to identify flood prone areas.

                                <p>
                                    I worked under the guidance of Dr. Gitakrishnan Ramadurai and Dr. Balaraman Ravindran in the RBCDSAI, a funded research centre at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras at Chennai, India. 
                                    I was a part of the team working with thr Tamil Nadu Health Systems Project to develop efficient algorithms to imporvise the Emergency Medicine System (EMS) in Tamil Nadu.
                                    I, along with the team, developed a fully interactive dashboard to present real time statistics of the EMS data. This was developed using Dash, Plotly and Holium packages. 
                                    The dashboard had a comprehensive view of the number of calls arriving, number of ambulances in service, and an interactive geospatial map showing the locations of the bases of ambulances.
                                    Using the textual data injested by the EMS personnel at the centre, we developed an algorithm to identify the incident location. 
                                    We combined a clustering algorithm using DBSCAN and an distance heuristic to identify the incident location.
                                    An accuracy of 87% across five different precision levels (location, street, landmark, colony and locality) was observed for this algorithm.
                                    <br> 
                                    Using the identified incident locations, we designed a static allocation algorithm using optimization techniques with a custom loss function. 
                                    The aim was to minimize the "cost" incurred when an ambulance is allocated to a request. 
                                    This algorithm optimized the usage of ambulances in the district of Chennai in Tamil Nadu by decreasing it by 13%.

                                    During this internship, I was a part of two projects where I collaborated with organizations such as Bosch and Intel. 
                                    I developed segmentation models to identfy defects in a package moving in the conveyer belt for Bosch factory plant in Bangalore, India. The images of the package captured from all sides was used for this purpose. The segmentation models were developed using the UNet and SDNet architectures.
                                    I also developed optical character recognition models to identify the label number for the same plant. Neural Network architectures using custom attention layers were used for this purpose.
                                    In order to analyse the performance of YOLO-V4 object detection models in Intel devices, I performed model optimization and performance evaluation of a sample YOLOv4 model developed on the COCO dataset using Intel OpenVino toolkit.I analysed the performance of the model on an Intel server utilising different cores and varying test dataset sizes and cumulated a detailed report for the results.

I worked on developing an ensemble model to find the optimal combination of atomic clock signals to obtain the time signal with most stability. A neural network model with a custom loss fucntion to minimize the Allan deviation value of the time signal was designed.
                                    This model provided a resultant time signal more stabilty, ie less deviation value in the range of 10^-17.
